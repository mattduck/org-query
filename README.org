* org-query

DISCLAIMER: this is in early stages of development. There are bugs, and the
design and APIs are liable to change. It is currently only on Github for my own
convenience.

** What is it?

Org-query is an org-mode addon that lets you generate alternative views of your
org headlines with custom filtering, grouping and sorting. Compared to
org-agenda, it offers more flexible / specific querying features, but has slower
performance.
